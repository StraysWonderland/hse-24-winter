## **2024 / 09 / 23 - Introduction to distributed systems - Overview Cloud Computing**  

### **Content Overview**
1. **The NIST Cloud Definition (2011)**
   - Breakdown of the NISTâ€™s five essential cloud characteristics, deployment models, and service models.
  
2. **Overview of Major Cloud Providers**
   - Key players in the cloud space (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).
   - Comparing evolution.

3. **Cloud Service/Abstraction Models**
   - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS revisited, with modern examples.
   - The evolution of abstraction models, including FaaS and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS).

4. **Introduction to CNCF**
   - Role of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the cloud ecosystem.
   - CNCF Landscape: technologies, tools, and projects.

5. **Popular Technologies**
   - **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration in cloud-native environments.
   - **eBPF**: Extending kernel capabilities for monitoring and security.
   - **OpenTelemetry**: Observability standards and practices in modern cloud systems.

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Describe the NIST cloud definition and its significance in the modern cloud landscape.
- Identify the major cloud providers and tell about their evolution.
- Differentiate between cloud service models and discuss their evolution, including modern abstraction models like CaaS.
- Explain the role of CNCF and analyze the CNCF landscape to identify key technologies and trends.
- Provide an overview of Kubernetes, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry, explaining their impact on cloud-native development.
